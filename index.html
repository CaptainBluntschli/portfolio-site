    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m not your average supply chain professional. I’m a Chartered Master Supply Chain Manager with a strategic mind, calloused hands, and an artistic streak.
      I’ve optimized logistics across continents, negotiated with international suppliers, and introduced technology that made operations smarter. I’ve also reared livestock,
      helped build communities, and illustrated comic strips that connect people to stories. My career is where efficiency meets empathy, and structure meets storytelling.

      <h3>Circular Economy Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        The circular economy challenges the traditional "take-make-dispose" model by promoting systems where resources are reused, regenerated, and reintegrated.
        At its core, it’s not just an environmental initiative—it’s an economic strategy aimed at decoupling growth from resource consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reflecting on it, the brilliance of the circular model lies in its efficiency. From biodegradable packaging to remanufactured electronics,
        it reshapes industries by treating waste as value. However, implementation isn’t plug-and-play. It demands systemic shifts: product redesigns,
        regulatory reforms, and supply chain transparency.
      </p>
      <p>
        As someone with a background in supply chain management, I recognize the tension: efficiency often favors linearity. But circularity requires intentional frictions—take-back schemes, modular designs, slower product cycles. These aren’t inefficiencies; they’re investments in long-term resilience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, the circular economy isn't a moral high ground—it's a strategic one. It's less about hugging trees and more about outsmarting scarcity.
        The future belongs to systems that can regenerate. Anything else is just borrowed time.
